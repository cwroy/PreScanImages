============================================================
This package contains scripts designed to extract body and surface coil images from the pre-scan in Siemens raw MRI data.
It is based off of the MAPVBVD code from Philipp Ehses and shared with permission. Note that the alignment and interpolation part of the
code has only been tested for 3D radial (Kooshball) trajectories in transverse orientation.
